# Comments Collection
Each comment is a document which is stored out of its hole document - here in a collection.

However, to determine whether to show an anonymous user or real name, one should check the `option`. If the display should be anonymous, then go and find according role based on `from_user.uid` and `hole_id`.

  "text": "This is a simple comment",
  "hole_id": "545efe76a98d930012da6d4b",

    "uid": "Alice"
  },
  "reply_to": {
    "comment_id": "545e28a80000000000000000"
  },
  "options": {
    "anonymous": true,
    "secret": false
  }
}
```
